# This script file is called by the geronimo.sh file (which is invoked
# by the startup.sh, shutdown.sh files).  This file is also invoked
# by the deploy.sh file.
#
# It is preferable (to simplify migration to future Geronimo releases)
# to set any environment variables you need in the setenv.sh file
# rather than modifying Geronimo's script files.  See the documentation
# in the geronimo.sh file for further information.
#
# (Based upon Apache Tomcat 5.5.12's setclasspath.sh)

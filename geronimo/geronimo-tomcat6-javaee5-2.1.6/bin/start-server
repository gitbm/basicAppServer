# Startup script for Geronimo that starts Geronimo in the foreground.
#
# This script calls the gsh script passing "geronimo/start-server" as the
# first argument followed by the arguments supplied by the caller.
#
# Alternatively you can use the more comprehensive gsh interface directly.
#
# Invocation Syntax:
#
#   start-server [geronimo_args ...]
#
# Environment Variable Prequisites:
#
#   Refer to the documentation in the gsh file for information
#   on environment variables etc.
#

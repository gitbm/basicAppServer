Files in this directory:

*-config.xml

When Geronimo is started it will read a configuration XML file from this
var/config directory.  By default the config.xml file is read, but an
alternative file can be used by setting the file name (relative to
the var/config directory) in the org.apache.geronimo.config.file system 
property.

The configuration XML file lists the serialized modules in the 
repository to be started.  For each module configured to be
started in the config.xml file, Geronimo loads a serialized module
from under the geronimo/repository directory.

A module can be marked as not to be loaded by setting the "load" attribute
to "false" on the "module" element for a module.

A module may contain GBeans.  Individual GBeans in a module can be
marked as not to be loaded by setting the "load" attribute to "false" on the
"gbean" element for a GBean.

Site specific information such as port numbers can be specified in GBean 
attributes to override the values in the serialized module.

Do not add comments to the config.xml file as the file is regenerated by 
Geronimo when changes are made to Geronimo's configuration, therefore any
comments added to this file will be lost.


*-config-substitutions.properties
   
Put variables and their substitution values in this file. 
They will be used when processing the corresponding config.xml. 
Values in this file can be overridden by environment variables and system properties 
by prefixing the property name with 'org.apache.geronimo.config.substitution.' 
For example, an entry such as hostName=localhost 
can be overridden by an environment variable or system property org.apache.geronimo.config.substitution.hostName=foo 
When running multiple instances of Geronimo choose a PortOffset value such that none of the ports conflict. 
For example, try PortOffset=10 


*-artifact-aliases.properties

You can use this file to indicate that you want to substitute one module for another.
format is oldartifactid=newartifactId e.g.
org.apache.geronimo.configs/transaction//car=org.apache.geronimo.configs/transaction/1.2-SNAPSHOT/car
versions can be ommitted on the left side but not the right.
This can also specify explicit versions in the same format.
